## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Miguel A. Redondo, a Bioinformatician at NBIS, Sweden

Hello! As a member of the Evolution and Biodiversity team at the National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden (NBIS), my role involves analyzing data for researchers benefiting from our long-term support and sharing my knowledge as a teacher in programming and statistics courses.

With a PhD in microbial ecology, my data analysis journey started with studies of ecological communities. I currently use machine and deep learning techniquesâ€”including, but not limited to, random forests, regularized regressions, neural networks, and convolutional neural networksâ€”to decipher the complexities of biological data.
